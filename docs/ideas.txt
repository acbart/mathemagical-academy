Mathemagical Academy
    You can either play story mode or play minigames directly.
    
    Storyline:
        * You are a new student at the Mathemagical Academy. 
        * Goal is to get points to win the school competition
        
    Minigames:
        Castle Exploration: Coordinate Grid
            * Similar to the original, you explore the castle by following instructions to move from coordinate to coordinate. 
            * You click on a tile, and you move there (quickly). 
            * If you go off the path outlined by the instructions, you run the risk of hitting Bad Stuff
                - having a ghost scare you
                - floor giving out (warps you back to the start)
                - walls apearing in front of you
                - teacher appearing and subtracting house points
            * Castle is randomly generated (I'm actually doing it this time)
        Potions: Converting Fractions, Find Missing Value Fractions (+/- fractions)
            * Similar to the original, you are brewing potions by following a recipe
            * You use N ingredients per potion (N > 1) (starts at 2 or 3, and increases with difficulty)
            * You are given the fractional quantity needed for the first n-1 ingredients, and the total amount needed (starts at 1, but increases with difficulty).
            * You must convert each fractional amount to decimal, fill in the missing decimal amount, and and then hit brew.
            * As you fill in decimal numbers, the sum is shown at the bottom, and cauldrons fill up (multiple cualdrons if the total amount is >1)
        Herbology: Multiplying and dividing fractions
            * Growing and shrinking plants with magic
            * You have a target height for a given plant, and you can multiply it or divide it with fractions.
            * Visually watch it grow
        Care of Magical Creatures: Reducing Fractions
            * Need to find the equivalent fractional amount of food by fractional reduction
            * Piles of food, each marked with a fractional amount
            * Drag and drop to the monster (or click a button underneath them)
            * Piles are visually sized
        Creature Taming: Comparing fractions
            * Card-based game where you try and tame creatures
            * Your hand has five cards; the creature will play one, and you have a few seconds to play your own
            * The cards have fractions on them; whoever plays the higher fraction wins the hand
            * As you win more hands, you tame the creatures. But they'll wear you down if you don't win enough
            * Some cards have special effects (restoring energy)
            * Monsters that are tamed can be used in the Flying minigame
        Flying: +/- fractions
            * Flying == Math Adder + Space Recycler
            * You have a target goal in the lower-right, and you pick up numbers and operators to reach that goal
            * You start off with a broom (average speed and acceleration), but can use creatures with better stats and abilities)
                * Hippogriffs - can blow numbers away
                * Dragon - firebreath doubles numbers
                * Pegasus - Increases odds of better numbers
                * Phoenix - can make short teleportations
